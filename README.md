# Colourrecognition
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been revolutionizing the way we interact with 
technology, and one of its applications is color detection. Color detection is used in a 
wide range of applications, from detecting traffic lights in autonomous vehicles to 
sorting objects in industrial settings. In this project, we aim to develop a color detection 
system using Python, OpenCV, CSV, NumPy, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
algorithm.

OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that provides tools for image and video 
processing. It provides a comprehensive set of functions for image processing, such as 
image filtering, edge detection, and feature detection. NumPy is a powerful numerical 
computing library for Python, which allows us to perform complex calculations on large 
arrays and matrices efficiently. The KNN algorithm is a machine learning algorithm 
that can be used for classification or regression problems.


It is a non-parametric algorithm that works by finding the K closest points to a given 
data point and classifying it based on the majority class of those K points.
We will be using a CSV file containing the RGB values of different colors, which will 
be used to train our KNN model. Then, we will use our model to detect the color of an 
image by finding the K closest colors to the given pixel and assigning the majority color 
to it.


In summary, this project aims to demonstrate the use of AI and machine learning in 
color detection, which can be useful in various applications. The use of Python, 
OpenCV, CSV, NumPy, and KNN algorithm makes the implementation of this project 
efficient and straightforward
